To automate the deployment and management of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) clusters using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), you can use the [Kubernetes provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs) for [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

Here's an example of how you can use Terraform to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/):

1. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) on your machine.
2. Set up a GCP account and create a project.
3. Create a service account with the necessary permissions to create and manage resources in your [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) project.
4. Download the JSON key file for the service account and store it in a secure location.
5. Define the provider and credentials for your GCP project in a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) configuration file.
