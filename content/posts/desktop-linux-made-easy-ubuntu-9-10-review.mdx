On October 29th, 2009, Canonical released their usual half yearly cycle software, Ubuntu codenamed “Karmic Koala”. Ubuntu, if you don’t already know, is a version or distro (distribution) of the GNU/Linux Operating System which is based on Debian. Ubuntu is aimed primarily at Desktop User, even though there is a fully qualified Server version available. A new version of this software is available every six months and comes with a whole bunch of other applications and features.

Karmic Koala (Ubuntu 9.10), is the release for the second half of 2009 and is termed by many of its users as “the best version of Ubuntu yet”. I will attempt in this article to discuss some of the features that makes this software so talked about.

I have been a user of the Ubuntu Operating system for quite sometime now and I also agree with the statement that Karmic Koala is the best version of Ubuntu yet. Why? Well, here are my reasons:

## Obtaining

Ubuntu is very easy to obtain. If you don’t already know it, all versions of Ubuntu is “Free” both in cost and in license. This means that you can obtain a copy by downloading it, copying from a friend, ask Canonical to Ship it to you (Yes! There is a free shipping to you service provided) or by purchasing a copy (usually cost is to cover expense for disc and time for burning etc).

A free copy of the latest version of Ubuntu is available free for download from the Ubuntu main website (http://www.ubuntu.com).

## Hardware Requirements

Ubuntu, by default, requires atleast 1Ghz Processor, 384MB Memory, A VGA Controller and about 4GB of Hard Disk space to install and function as a fully operational system. The GNU/Linux Operating System on the whole is known to require very minimum amount of system resources to run. Ubuntu has be configured in many different ways to run on systems with as low as 64MB of RAM. See Xubuntu.

Of course, having a meatier system, which is a common thing today, would mean that your system will run a lot faster and be capable enough to enable many of the enhancements etc. that Ubuntu has to offer.

The hardware that I used to test this version on it a modest AMD Athlon 64 3500+ Processor, 1GB DDR 3200 RAM, 128MB GeForce FX5200 Graphics and 200GB Hard Disk space.

## Boot Time

Karmic Koala, follows in the footsteps of its predecessor Jaunty Jackalope (Ubuntu 9.04) with an amazing boot up time. In my opinion, Karmic does a better job at the boot time that Jaunty. With my system, it took just about 25.8s to boot to the login screen, and about another 8s to load the desktop. Please note that this is with the stock install and boot time may vary with the specs on your system or with services or software that you have running during boot time.

## Installation

I must point out here that Ubuntu comes on a CD with a Live/Install feature, that allows you to run the Operating System, check out features etc. as a Live Session from the disc without altering your present System configuration. In it’s attempt to make GNU/Linux to be easy for “normal” desktop users, has made it very easy for you to install on your system. Most persons would want to install Ubuntu on their system without having to alter what they already have. Ubuntu, in many ways makes the process easier for new and advance users alike. With the WUBI, you can even install Ubuntu into your Windows System!

## Look and Feel

Karmic Koala, come with a theme that is pleasant and easy on the eyes. The default theme is simple and clean with no messy desktop icons etc. Ubuntu has changed the default theme colour in this disto, from dark brown to a lighter shade. The icons also appear very pleasing to the eyes, and makes it simple to understand and find the things that you are looking for.

This version also ships with, a basic layer of Compiz Fusion which enables the system to have that glossy, embossed look. Compiz can be upgraded to the advanced features with will enable you to do awesome things with your computer.

## Software & Drivers

By default, Ubuntu picked up most of my Hardware and installed them. The only difficulty i had, and I think I will always have, is to install my NVidia GeForce FX5200 Graphics Card with I usually have to do manually. However, Karmic installed a generic video driver which works well for the job i wanted it to do. Everything else, including my wifi card worked out-of-the-box.

Ubuntu CD packages come with many applications that suits the basic needs of the user, pre-installed. One of those key software is OpenOffice, which is a fully qualified office suite and contains programs to meet all your office purposes. There is also applications that will allow you to browse the internet, chat, email client, and a whole bunch of cool tools that will allow you to make your experience easier.

Karmic comes with the Ubuntu Software Center, which is an improved model of the “Add/Remove Programs” in other OSes that allows users to easily search and find Linux Applications to suit their need and install them.Note that to install these applications would require a connection to the Internet. Remember, most of these applications are available for free and Ubuntu makes the integration a very easy process.

## Miscellaneous

Here are some other things that I think is worth mentioning at this time. Karmic, come with the Empathy which is an excellent Instant Messenger Client and work well with all your messenger services integrated into one application.
Even though Linux has not been famous for its gaming ability, Ubuntu does support a great amount of gaming.
Ubuntu One, is a new feature in Karmic which allows you to sync/backup 2GB of your data for FREE! to a Ubuntu Cloud. There is more storage available for a small price. See
Ubuntu One

## Summary/Conclusion

The final assessment is that Ubuntu has developed a great piece of software that a regular non-technical user can use with very little trouble.Even though a full description of a desktop/laptop scenario is described here, Ubuntu is a great piece of software for NetBook OS or Servers too

I do hope you find the experience using this software as inviting and exciting as I did. Cheers!
