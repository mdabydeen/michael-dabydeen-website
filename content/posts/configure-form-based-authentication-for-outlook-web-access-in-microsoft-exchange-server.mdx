Implementing Form Based Authentication (FBA) for Outlook Web Access (OWA) in Microsoft Exchange is a straightforward and easy process. By using FBA, your users can enjoy the convenience of accessing their email services in a similar manner to popular web-based email providers like GMail, Yahoo Mail, and Hotmail.

## Advantages of Form Based Authentication (FBA)

There are several security benefits to implementing FBA:

1. **Session Expiration**: If a session remains inactive for a certain period, it will expire. Users must re-authenticate to regain access.
2. **No Password Remembering**: Users are unable to utilize the "Remember my password" feature in Internet Explorer.
3. **Secure Log Out**: When logging out, users are completely logged out, requiring re-authentication to access the system again.

In the past, with Exchange 2000, users had to close the browser window to complete the logout session.

## Steps to Implement FBA

**Configure OWA with SSL**: Follow the instructions in this post to set up SSL for OWA. This step won't be discussed further here.

Once you have successfully configured SSL, you need to enable Forms-Based Authentication on the HTTP Virtual Server in Microsoft Exchange System Manager. Here's how:

1. Open Exchange System Manager.
2. Locate and expand your server object.
3. Expand Protocols and then HTTP.
4. Right-click on the Exchange Virtual Server and choose Properties.
5. In the Settings tab, select the Enable Forms Based Authentication check-box.
6. Click OK and dismiss any warning messages by clicking OK again.
7. Restart the IIS services either from the Services snap-in or the IIS Admin snap-in.

## Client-side Configuration

No specific client-side configuration is required. Simply direct your clients' web browsers to the same URL they used before, but replace "HTTP" with "HTTPS." A security warning may appear, notifying them that they are entering a secure site. If you have correctly configured your SSL digital certificate as described in this post, everything should function properly.
