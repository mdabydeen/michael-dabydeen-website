The team from [Dakeung.com](http://dakeung.com), consisting of Darryl and Michael, actively participated in the [Software Freedom Day](https://www.softwarefreedomday.org/) 2009 activities
organized by the [Guyana Linux Users Group (GLUG)](https://glug.org.gy).

Darryl, an experienced presenter and tech enthusiast, delivered an engaging and informative session on the topic of simplifying web conferencing through the use of the [DimDim Software](http://www.dimdim.com).
