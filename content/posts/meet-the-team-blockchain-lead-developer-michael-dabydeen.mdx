One of the main questions we always get asked is, “How does blockchain work?”

Is it bitcoin, is it a new type of “internet”, perhaps 2018’s new golden term?

One of the biggest problems when it comes to revolutionary technology, is the learning process, and with blockchain it’s no different.

When it comes to blockchain, only about a handful of people can say they fully understand how the technology is applied to multiple different industries to increment efficiency, as well as transparency.

It’s Skrumble Network’s mission to give back data ownership to a community of people who can not communicate privately or share information without the fear of being hacked, manipulated or censored.

But, technology like this doesn’t build itself.

It is developed by the pioneers who believe in change and are open to new procedures for the sake of constant innovation. This is where our very own Michael Dabydeen comes in!

Michael, Skrumble Network’s Blockchain Lead Developer, believes decentralized processes are the future of data storage and communication.

Over the past couple of years, Michael has been developing various blockchain solutions for real world problems. This time, communication.

We chatted with Michael, along with our amazing, but very busy, dev team to ask for a quote on his personal take when it comes to why we decided to go with blockchain and decentralized solutions for our project:

"Smart contracts and blockchain authentication present a secure, transparent, and conflict-free way to exchange communication on the blockchain. It works with blocks which contain a hash of other previous blocks. Every block header contains a previous field from its previous block, which then creates a chain of blocks in which you can easily trace where information came from and where it went. In the field of transparency, this is the most secure means of information sharing there is out there. The beauty of this technology is all of the different uses it has. In the cryptocurrency space, bitcoin transactions are made on a public chain, also known as an un-permissioned chain, where everybody has full access of the chain and can ‘mine’ the desired transactions. It is interesting to see the use of the technology on an open scale (transactions), and how different the uses for private and secure communications are, as well as the process to get there."

With a soon to be launched Test-Net and the recent release of our Beta Version 0.01 Android app, Michael makes sure we hit every single milestone of our roadmap with a BANG!

Building a decentralized communication application is no piece of cake!

Michael drives the Skrumble Network mission with a high level of knowledge, quality performance and the kind of determined behavior needed to change a whole industry’s approach on how we share information using blockchain technology.

So pretty much what we’re saying is that we have the right team leader to bring our already running Alpha Test-Net into further bloom.
