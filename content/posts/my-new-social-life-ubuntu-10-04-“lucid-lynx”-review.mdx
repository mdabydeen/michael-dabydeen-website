"Change is here!" That is the banner under which [Canonical](https://web.archive.org/web/20121221022901/http://www.canonical.com/) is marketing their latest addition to the table called Lucid Lynx, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Long Term Support).

After working on it for the last two days, I must say "It rocks!" There are lots of changes as promised and much lived up to the expectations.

In this article, I will attempt to do two things; namely, explain to you a little about Ubuntu as well as address some of the changes made in this release.

**Background**

[Ubuntu](https://web.archive.org/web/20121221022901/http://www.ubuntu.com/), if you don't know already, is a distribution of GNU/Linux and is based on Debian.

Now, like you, I always wondered why the name Lucid? It is not any different than the previous names we have had before. We had Intrepid Ibex,Jaunty Jackalope, Karmic Koala, to name the last three. Two things seem common about the naming pattern; it has a double letters following in alphabetical order from its predecessor and it is a description of an animal. The said description is usually the focus of what the software should be.

Now, just like you, I always wonder why and what goes into the making of the name.

According to the [Ubuntu Fridge](https://web.archive.org/web/20121221022901/http://fridge.ubuntu.com/), "The Lynx is a predator that depends on very considered tactical positioning for success. It's a small cat, which fits nicely with the lean nature of Ubuntu on both the desktop and the server. It's stylish and sleek, the bow-tie-adorned James Bond of the feline set, so you can bet we'll make sure it's dressed for the occasion. The lynx likes to keep things in perspective, sticking to high ground. And it's the national animal of Macedonia, a country that has deployed tens of thousands of Ubuntu desktops in schools."

The next thing I want to get out of the way is what is the whole LTS thing about? Simply put, LTS stands for Long Term Support. This means "with the LTS version you get 3 years support on Ubuntu Desktop, and 5 years on Ubuntu Server." for no extra fee or charge.

Remember that Ubuntu promises and delivers a new release of the software every six months. Each release features the latest and greatest of the software. However an LTS version is something that can be considered by Systems Administrators for the Network as well as Desktop Users who do not like to be upgrading their computers every six months.

**Expectations**

The first thing about every new release of Ubuntu is that there are lots of great expectations. A simple Google search would reveals tons of different things people from all corners of the globe wanted out of   Lucid Lynx.

Even I, a long time Ubuntu User (5 yrs), had my own expectations. My primary expectation was that Ubuntu will become tailored to meet the average desktop user without losing the Ubuntu or GNU/Linux philosophy. Also that is still represents the ideals of its parent software, Debian.

**Features**

Lucid Lynx is loaded with new features. Enough to make you very excited about it, enough to make you want to download it and try it out immediately. All of the new features are listed on [Ubuntu's Website](https://web.archive.org/web/20121221022901/http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/1004features)

Let's discuss some of these exciting new features:

**Interface** -- Ubuntu has finally changed its looks from the brown to a much more sober color. It's a mix of pink and burgundy with a dark effect that is easy on the eyes. Many persons have complained about it, but in my opinion it brings a much needed change in the look and feel of the software.

**Usability** -- Again, Ubuntu is very easy to use and navigate. A test was conducted with persons who never used the software before, to try conducting simple tasks like browse the internet etc. and this was done with much ease. Accessibility features have been one of the key areas focused on in this release.

**Configuration -- **Ubuntu has always been hard to configure. However, with each new release the configurations are made easier. It has become even easier now with the integration of a Software Centre that allows you to easily find, download and install programs.

**The Excitement**

**_Social Integration_** -- Almost everyone today is on a social network. Facebook and Twitter seems to be the cream of the crop. Ubuntu team is aware of this. This is why the most exciting new addition to the Ubuntu release is the integration of an enhanced Gwibber -- an application which integrates all you social networks into one window -- and Empathy, the application that integrates all your chat clients into one, including Facebook and MySpace IM.

**_Me Menu_** -- Ubuntu now comes with a "Me Menu" that allows users to change the status on Empathy (all IM Clients) from a tab next to the logout menu. All considered it makes life much easier, doesn't it?

***Ubuntu One* -- **The latest addition to Ubuntu since 2009 continues to be offered. Two GBs of remote storage where you can backup your files to an Amazon EC2 Cloud Server for free. A paid service is offered for $10/month for a 50GB Service

**_Ubuntu Music_** -- A Music Store! You can download albums and songs at a cheap cost right into your Media Player (RhythmBox).

**The Performance**

**_Hardware --_** Even though Ubuntu still runs like a charm on 384MB RAM for a Live CD and 256MB for the installed version, I would recommend that you use something much more. 512MB is my recommended standard, but 1GB or more is best for the most awesome experience.

**_Boot Time_** -- "I have never seen an OS that boots this fast!" was someone sentiments for Lucid Lynx. For an OS that boots under 30s, I guess that is enough said.

**_Installation_** -- Again, Installation is simple and easy. It is very straightforward. Upgrading from 9.10 or 8.04LTS is also very easy (with a decent internet connection).

**Summary**

Lucid is an OS in a bottle, if I am allowed to say it. It is everything that I want in an Operating System. It's simple, secure and packaged with all of the basic software that I need. It also comes with features that help to make my new life i.e. my social life online (Facebook, Twitter) much easier.

Having all the functionality in one piece, now that is the software that I want. This is why Ubuntu is my software and Lucid Lynx gets 5 out 5 stars from me.
